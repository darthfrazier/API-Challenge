CODE2040 API Challenge Documentation

Thanks for completing the CODE2040 enrollment application. The final step in the application process for the Fellows Program is our API Challenge. If you haven’t yet completed your application, go do that first.

We use this challenge to assess your ability to learn and apply your coding skills -- and show our host companies you’re ready to pitch in.

Never connected to an API before? You can do this! We’ll walk you through how to think about the problem and provide some tips on how to find advice. You can try as many times as you like. The API will let you know when you’ve gotten it right. Outside reference materials are encouraged -- they’re a normal part of development. Don’t be shy about using Google.

Here’s a great post on teaching yourself, by 2014 Fellow Christian Rodriguez, to pump up your confidence.

You can complete the API challenge using the language and platform you’re most comfortable with. While you could probably work out a way to make the API happy using manual input, we’re also going to ask you to share the code you use -- and we’ll be sharing that code with potential employers, as well. It doesn’t have to be perfect. It just has to show you can solve problems as a programmer.

The more stages you complete in the challenge, the more you’ll stick out. For bonus points, complete the challenge steps in multiple languages, or build an interesting user interface around the work your code is doing.

I have completed the Java implementation of the API challenge, and I will soon upload some html files that will contain the javascript implementation.
I hope to also do it in python, but the will likely be after the december 1st due date.

Thanks!
